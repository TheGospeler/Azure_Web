### MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship Project
This repository was created to test the runtime optimization for robust machine learning web applications using the web services offered by Azure Cloud Platform.

#### Goal and Questions:
- Identify web app services that reduces the runtime for the four algorithms used for the ML application.
- What are the elements that improves the runtime speed for machine learning applications in terms of cloud computing infrastructure.
- Will more sophisticated web services increase the runtime computational speed?
